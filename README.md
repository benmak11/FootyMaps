## Footy Maps

Footy-Maps brings every loving football fan close together for a little footy challenge in the park. This is an iOS app which uses [Facebook Auth](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a backend to serve as an application to connect fellow football fans for a little game of footy.

## Current status of development

This application is currently still under development but the code freeze date is still `To Be Determined`.

### Important notice

The master `branch` will serve as the release cycle branch but all other branches of development will be hidden.
